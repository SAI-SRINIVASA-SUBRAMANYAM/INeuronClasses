        * Write a function which takes string and returns the length of the string
        * Reverse the string without reverse method
        * Read the string and convert to upper/lower/capitalize case
        * Write a lambda function that concatenate two strings passed
    B. List:
        * Concatenate multiple lists into a single list(i.e., source)
        * From a given list of heterogeneous list of entries extract only list types
        * Try to filter all the string data
        * Try to extract alpha numeric data
        * Get multiplication of all the numeric values from collection
        * Unwrap collection inside a collection and create a flat list
        * Replicate the list methods append, extend, pop
        * Lambda function to return squares of given list
    C. Dictionary:
        * Take dictionary as argument and return list as an argument
        * From a given list of heterogeneous list of entries extract only dict types
        * Try to extract all the numerical data it may be a part of dict key or value
        * Get number of keys from dictionary element
